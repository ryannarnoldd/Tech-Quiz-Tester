## Description

This is a Tech Quiz Test Suite for Module 19: Testing. The purpose of this project is to enhance a fully functioning Tech Quiz application by implementing Cypress testing for both component and end-to-end tests. The application is built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.

In this project, Cypress has been configured for testing, ensuring the application runs reliably under various conditions.
